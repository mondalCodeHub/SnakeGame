# Snake Game 

A snake game is a simple game in which a snake moves around a box trying to eat food. The snake's length grows as it successfully consumes the apple. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the snake consumes food, its score gradually rises. I've also added a high core facility to the game. The high score is initially set to 0, but if someone beats the previous high score, the new score is updated as the new high score.
